## Howdy!

I am an IT professional who is obsessed with learning anything about everything. Right now, I'm:
Focused on cybersecurity
Well-versed in systems & help desk administration 
Dedicated to growth

Throughout my career I've found that most solutions already exist, but you usually have to dig through the weeds to find them. Along the way, you become conflicted with differing opinions and overloaded with irrelevant information. I seek to provide a one stop shop for most IT-related solutions, as a result of my personal endeavors and straightforward solution development.

Feel free to provide feedback or reach out to me. Collaboration is the lifeblood of growth!
